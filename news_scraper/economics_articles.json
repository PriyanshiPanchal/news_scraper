Second, Today, Indian companies get full infrastructure projects, like contracts worth billions of dollars to build gas compression systems. While they are far and few, after surviving a major slow down after the global financial crisis, Indian engineering companies have come a long way. Will exports be the next big frontier for them.

{"Article URL": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india", "Title": "India", "Author Name": "Unknown", "Author URL": null, "Article Content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was planning a visit to Kyiv in late August, aligning with Ukraine's National Day. The visit aimed to promote peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. After Kyiv, Modi was expected to visit Poland. Previous meetings emphasized India's commitment to a peaceful resolution. Criticism followed Modi's recent Russia visit, highlighting global tensions. The Paris Olympics 2024 have officially opened in France, marking a significant milestone in the country's Olympic history. The Ambassador of France to India, Thierry Mathou, expressed his best wishes to the Indian contingent, stating that the games provide an opportunity for cooperation between the two nations in sports.  Aditya Roy Kapur turned heads as the showstopper for designer Kunal Rawal at India Couture Week, wearing a deep blue sherwani paired with black dhoti-style pants and sporting a bushy beard for added allure. Several opposition-ruled states have announced they will boycott the meeting. Chief Ministers of three Congress-ruled States - Karnataka's Siddaramaiah, Himachal Pradesh's Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu and Telangana's Revanth Reddy have announced they will not attend the meeting over alleged bias against their States in the recently presented Union Budget. A three-storey building in Navi Mumbai's Shahbaz village collapsed early on Saturday morning, potentially trapping several people inside. According to officials, two individuals have been rescued, while efforts continue to save two more who are believed to be trapped. More than 1,700 pilgrims departed from a base camp early on Saturday to visit the Amarnath shrine in the south Kashmir Himalayas, amid heightened security. Over 4.45 lakh pilgrims have already visited the ice lingam at the 3,880-metre high cave shrine, officials said. The pilgrim footfall at the shrine is expected to surpass last year's total of 4.5 lakh later in the day. A three-storey building in Navi Mumbai's Shahbaz village collapsed early on Saturday morning, potentially trapping several people inside. According to officials, two individuals have been rescued, while efforts continue to save two more who are believed to be trapped. India accelerated its Act East Policy under Modi 3.0 with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval visiting Laos and Myanmar. Jaishankar attended Asean meetings, while Doval engaged with Myanmar's leadership. Highlights included India's rising engagement with Asean and Bimstec to counter China's influence. Doval also attended a Vietnamese Communist Party leader’s funeral and held discussions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the 25th anniversary of the Kargil War, paid tribute to fallen soldiers and addressed terrorism concerns, particularly from Pakistan. He emphasized India's resilience in Ladakh and J&K, highlighting the abrogation of Article 370 and its positive impacts. Modi also mentioned the ongoing Shinkun La tunnel project for better connectivity to Leh. At one of the previous hearings, the court had disapproved of the way a Muzaffarnagar school teacher allegedly spurred students into slapping the boy as punishment and made a communal remark. The alleged incident was reported in August last year. The court last September raised \"serious objections\" to the manner in which the probe was being dealt with by the UP Police. It had previously ordered the UP government to nominate a senior IPS officer to head the probe into the case. SC had also pointed out the \"omissions\" in the FIR registered by the UP Police. Several BJP-ruled states have announced reservation for Agniveers in government jobs, following PM Modi's call to absorb them post-retirement. Haryana, UP, Chhattisgarh, MP, and Uttarakhand have all committed to prioritizing Agniveers in police and other state jobs, highlighting efforts to harness their skills and discipline. The final NEET-UG 2024 rankings revealed 17 toppers with a perfect score of 720/720, following a court ruling on a disputed physics question. Initially, 67 students were toppers. The examination for 2.33 lakh students had issues like grace marks and paper leaks. The Supreme Court has extended its interim stay on the directive requiring eateries and shops along the kanwar route to display names of owners and employees. Uttar Pradesh clarified that the order aimed to ensure a peaceful yatra. The Court emphasized that displaying names voluntarily is allowed. The stay continues until the next hearing on August 5. Manipur has been battling ethnic violence since May 3 last year. Biren stated in X, “ It was a pleasure meeting the Defence Minister, @rajnathsingh Ji, in New Delhi today. We had an in-depth discussion about the situation in Manipur. I also requested Shri @rajnathsingh Ji to expedite the handover of the Koirengei Air Field land to the State Government.” The Tripura High Court upheld a two-year rigorous imprisonment for three CPI-M leaders for causing disruption in a courtroom and insulting a judge nine years ago during a nationwide shutdown. This verdict, initially delivered by the South Tripura District and Sessions Court, was challenged unsuccessfully by the leaders at higher judicial levels. Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, celebrated the recognition of Maidams of Charaideo as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The declaration honors the valor of the Ahom kings and the cultural pride of the Assamese people. Sonowal, during his tenure as Chief Minister of Assam, played a crucial role in achieving this feat by organizing key events and securing funds for the project. The initiative received strong support from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the state government, which facilitated the global acknowledgment of the Maidams' historical significance.
